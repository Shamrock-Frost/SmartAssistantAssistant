# Serverside
	- Research [Alexa Skills](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html) & [Google Actions](https://developers.google.com/actions/reference/rest/conversation-webhook) request/reponse json formats
	- Research the [web-server](https://docs.racket-lang.org/web-server/index.html) library
	- Implement language _on top of racket_, i.e. one which `provide`s all racket functionality, and has built in macros for e.g. `define/server` or something

# Build
	- Use [SMAPI](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/smapi) and [gactions](https://developers.google.com/actions/tools/gactions-cli) to deploy user projects automagically
	- Add AWS Lambda/stdlib/Firebase support (low priority and likelihood)
