## Overview

SmartAssistantAssistant (SAA) is a racket library/language. 
It's technically two languages, saa-alexa-json and saa-google-json. 
They're parsed differently, but written exactly the same way. 
To get your code to compile on the other, simply switch the #lang. 
No other code changes required!
